		 * Employee Id • Name • Batch Code Note: • Create a Class Trainee with instance
		 * variables employeeId and name with appropriate constructor and getter /
		 * setters. • Declare and initialize static variable BATCH_CODE in Trainee class
		 * as mentioned below. private static final String BATCH_CODE = “CHNFSD”; •
		 * Create a method display() in Trainee class to display the details to the
		 * user. • In each Java class the code should be organized in such a way the
		 * declarations are done in the order specified below. Please ensure that this
		 * order is organized in this class. static variables o instance variables o
		 * constructors o getters and setters o other methods • Create a class Main
		 * which does the following: o Read the number of Trainees details to be read o
		 * Read each Trainee employeeId and name. o Create an instance of Trainee class
		 * and invoke the display() method. Sample Input and Output: Enter the number of
		 * Trainees 2 Enter Employee Id 969143 Enter Name John Enter Employee Id 969144
		 * Enter Name Priya 969143 John CHNFSD 969144 Priya CHNFSD
