	 * Question 40 : Display Trainee Details Write a program to read and display the
	 * Trainee details for the batch CHNFSD. Read the following Trainee details from
	 * the user: • Employee Id • Name Display the following details to the user: •
	 * Employee Id • Name • Batch Code Note: • Create a Class Trainee with instance
	 * variables employeeId and name with appropriate constructor and getter /
	 * setters. • Declare and initialize static variable BATCH_CODE in Trainee class
	 * as mentioned below. private static final String BATCH_CODE = “CHNFSD”; •
	 * Create a method display() in Trainee class to display the details to the
	 * user. • In each Java class the code should be organized in such a way the
	 * declarations are done in the order specified below. Please ensure that this
	 * order is organized in this class. static variables o instance variables o
	 * constructors o getters and setters o other methods • Create a class Main
	 * which does the following: o Read the number of Trainees details to be read o
	 * Read each Trainee employeeId and name. o Create an instance of Trainee class
	 * and invoke the display() method. Sample Input and Output: Enter the number of
	 * Trainees 2 Enter Employee Id 969143 Enter Name John Enter Employee Id 969144
	 * Enter Name Priya 969143 John CHNFSD 969144 Priya CHNFSD
