		 * Question 24 : Profit and Loss Sam purchased x dozens of toys at the rate of
		 * Rs. y per dozen. He sold each one of them at the rate of Rs. z. Can you
		 * please help him out percentage of profit? Given the values of x, y and z,
		 * write a program to compute Sam's profit percentage. Example: Dozens of toys
		 * purchased (x) = 20 Rate per dozen (y) = Rs. 375 Selling price per toy (z) =
		 * Rs. 33 Cost Price of 1 toy = 375/12 = Rs. 31.25 Selling Price of 1 toy =
		 * Rs.33 Profit = 33 - 31.25 = Rs. 1.75 Profit % = 1.75 / 31.25 * 100 = 5.6%
		 * Input Format: Input consists of 3 integers – x, y and z. x - Number of dozens
		 * purchased. y - Cost per dozen. z - Selling price per item. Output Format: The
		 * profit percentage needs to be printed correct to 2 decimal places. Sample
		 * Input and Output: number of dozens of toys purchased 20 price per dozen 375
		 * selling price of 1 toy 33 Sam's profit percentage is 5.60 percent
		 */

		/*
		 * PsuedoCode: create three variables
		 * find the actual price of one toy
		 * find the profit from selling price and actual price
		 * find the profit percentage by multiplying 100 with profilt/actual price of one toy
		 * return the answer
